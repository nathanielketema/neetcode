"""
You are given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers. Each integer in nums is 
in the range [1, n] inclusive.

Every integer appears exactly once, except for one integer which appears two or more times. 
Return the integer that appears more than once.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,2,2]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4]
Output: 4

Follow-up: Can you solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using O(1) extra space?

Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 10000
    nums.length == n + 1
    1 <= nums[i] <= n
